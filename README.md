# unifi
My first iOS app that I built as my final project for the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program. It was my first time building an app and I was self-taught in Swift, since it was not a language that was taught in the program. Additionally, it was my first time designing wire frames. My team and I were able to produce a Proof of Concept (PoC).
